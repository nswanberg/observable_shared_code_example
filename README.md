# observable_shared_code_example
POC for using Observable Framework with NPM Workspaces to share common code

Tests using code from a common local module in Observable projects.

To run:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory
3. cd to `./observable-project` and run `npm run dev`

You should see a notebook that references a sum function defined in the `shared-code` module.
